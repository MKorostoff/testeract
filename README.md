The testeract is an application that generates a set of all possible sets. The name is a combination of "test" and "tesseract" 

For instance, say you were building an online store, and you wanted to generate a list of every product you plan to sell. Suppose you sell want to sell shirts in two sizes (large and small) and two colors (black and white). The set of sets contains 4 items: large black, small black, large white, small white. This is called "the cartesian product."

For data with only two dimensions (like size and color) it's pretty easy to represent in a spreadsheet with columns and rows. But once you add more dimensions, it gets really hard to represent in a maintainable way.
