Source code for https://mkorostoff.github.io/testeract/

The testeract is an application that generates a set of all possible sets. For instance, if I'm writing some software, and need to think of all the browser/device/breakpoint combinations, rather than writing them all out, I can input a list of browsers, a list of devices, and a list of breakpoints, and it will spit out every possible combination of those variables. The name is a combination of "test" and "tesseract." 

See [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/MKorostoff/testeract/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for planned features.
